# Mathematic for Electrical Power System Analysis

The purpose of this library development is to put into practice engineering calculations in the field power system analysis. So far, the topics include:

- Vector mathematic
- Matrix Algebra
- Calculation with voltage, current, power, and impedance
- Calculation in phasor (complex) values
- Calculation in Per-Unit system
- Voltage and current relationship in three-phase AC system
- Load flow calculation
